# Quantum-Computer-Simulator-
This is a Swift Playground I created for my WWDC Scholarship Submission 

You can run my program in Xcode (Mac) or Swift Playgrounds (iPad)

Quantum Computing is where the two things that I love the most come together: Quantum Mechanics and Computer Science. So, when I was thinking of an idea for my playground, this was the first thing that came to my mind. I wanted to create a playground where I could simulate a Quantum Computers and also teach others about Quantum Computing.

My playground consists primarily of two parts: A Simulator to simulate a Quantum Computer and a Tutorial to teach people how to use it. I  have tried to keep the tutorial as simple as possible. To avoid complicating things for users who may not know about Complex Numbers yet, I have excluded all Complex Operations and added them to the Appendix. I have also added a tab to introduce myself.

The math behind Quantum Computers is complex. To understand Quantum Computers, one must first learn about Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Complex Numbers, 3D Geometry etc.
But, I wanted to take a different approach. I wanted to teach people about Quantum Computers by just using the concepts of High School Math and Computer Science. People generally assume that Quantum Computing comes under Physics, but it is as much Computer Science as it is Physics. I wanted to highlight this fact in my Playground. So, instead of seeing gates as Matrix Multiplication, I describe them as swapping elements in an array. Both of them give the result but one is from a Mathematical perspective while the other is from a Computer Science perspective.

Quantum Computers are more of a reality than fiction today.
