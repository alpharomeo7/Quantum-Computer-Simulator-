# Quantum-Computer-Simulator-
This is a Swift Playground I created for my WWDC Scholarship Submission 

If you want you run the simulator on your device, Download and Unzip  the .zip file

If you want to have look at the code, go to the folder titled QuantumComputerSimulator
Note : Most of the files are part of the UI/UX, 
If you're interested in the working, look at : https://github.com/alpharomeo7/Quantum-Computer-Simulator-/blob/master/QuantumComputerSimulator/Sources/QuantumCore.swift

You can run my program in Xcode (Mac) or Swift Playgrounds (iPad)

Please send a review to ajay.rajendra.rawat@gmail.com, it'll really help me.


My playground consists primarily of two parts: A Simulator to simulate a Quantum Computer and a Tutorial to teach people how to use it. I  have tried to keep the tutorial as simple as possible. To avoid complicating things for users who may not know about Complex Numbers yet, I have excluded all Complex Operations and added them to the Appendix. I have also added a tab to introduce myself.



Quantum Computers are more of a reality than fiction today. :)
