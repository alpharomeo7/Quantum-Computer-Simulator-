# Quantum-Computer-Simulator-
This is a Swift Playground I created for my WWDC Scholarship Submission 

You can run my program in Xcode (Mac) or Swift Playgrounds (iPad)

Please send a review to ajay.rajendra.rawat@gmail.com, it'll really help me.


My playground consists primarily of two parts: A Simulator to simulate a Quantum Computer and a Tutorial to teach people how to use it. I  have tried to keep the tutorial as simple as possible. To avoid complicating things for users who may not know about Complex Numbers yet, I have excluded all Complex Operations and added them to the Appendix. I have also added a tab to introduce myself.



Quantum Computers are more of a reality than fiction today. :)
